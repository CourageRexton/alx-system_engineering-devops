# Web stack debugging #0

In this debugging series, I was tasked with finding broken/bugged webstacks
and writing Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a
working state.

## Tasks :page_with_curl

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a 
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
